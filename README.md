# VISIONIX – 3D Warehouse Robot Simulation

VISIONIX is a browser-based 3D warehouse simulation built using **Three.js** and **Vite**. It demonstrates how an autonomous warehouse robot can navigate a warehouse, move toward a destination, avoid obstacles, and recalculate its route when the path is blocked.

## Features

- **3D Warehouse Environment** – Interactive warehouse with shelves and a robot.
- **Robot Movement** – Manual and autonomous movement.
- **A* Pathfinding** – Calculates routes through the warehouse grid.
- **Obstacle Handling** – Detects blocked paths and recalculates routes.
- **Route Visualization** – Displays planned and updated routes.
- **Destination Indicator** – Highlights the robot's target.
- **Interactive Camera** – Drag to change the view and zoom to inspect the warehouse.
- **Responsive Rendering** – Adjusts to browser window resizing.

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Purpose |
|---|---|
| JavaScript | Application logic |
| Three.js | 3D scene and rendering |
| Vite | Development server and build tooling |
| HTML and CSS | Page structure and styling |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install Node.js and npm.

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maheshgowdass2006-bit/visionix-robot.git
cd visionix-robot
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Start the development server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open the local URL printed in the terminal, usually `http://localhost:5173/`.

### 4. Create a production build

```bash
npm run build
```

## How It Works

1. Three.js creates the 3D warehouse environment.
2. The navigation area is represented as a grid.
3. The A* algorithm calculates a path from the robot to its destination.
4. The robot follows the calculated route in autonomous mode.
5. When an obstacle blocks the route, the simulation can calculate an alternative path.

## Controls

- Use the on-screen controls for autonomous movement.
- Use **W, A, S, D** for manual movement.
- Drag the mouse to adjust the camera.
- Use the mouse wheel to zoom.
